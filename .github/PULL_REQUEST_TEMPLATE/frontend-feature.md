## QA Checklist

Before requesting a review, you should review this checklist and address any requirements you missed.

- [ ] I have used semantic HTML wherever necessary on the feature.
- [ ] I have run an automated a11y checker (like [Accessibility Insights for Web](https://accessibilityinsights.io/)) and fixed any issues.
- [ ] I have implemented the feature faithfully to design.
- [ ] I have implemented the feature responsively. If mobile designs don't exist, I've used my best judgment to provide a good mobile experience. I have also considered intermediate viewport sizes and styled elements to scale and flow fluidly.
- [ ] I have tested that the feature can support content of varying lengths, not just lorem ipsum or what's shown in design.
- [ ] I have tested the feature in a production build, not just in local development.
