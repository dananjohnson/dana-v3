title: More on “The Great Divide”
---

This is largely how I feel, too: loving the work on both sides of the “divide,” but straining to master disparate and sometimes only loosely-related skills.

> Right now, I'm enjoying working with React as a UI library, Apollo GraphQL for data, Cypress for integration testing, and webpack as a build tool. I am constantly eying up CSS-in-JS libraries. Yet, while I do consider those things a part of front-end development, they feel cosmically far away from the articles and conversations around accessibility, semantic markup, CSS possibilities, UX considerations, and UI polish, among others. It feels like two different worlds.
