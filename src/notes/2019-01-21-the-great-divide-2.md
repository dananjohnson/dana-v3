title: More on “The Great Divide”
---

This is largely how I feel, too: loving the work on both sides of the “divide,” but straining to master disparate and sometimes only loosely-related skills.

> Right now, I'm enjoying working with React as a [UI]{.sc} library, Apollo Graph[QL]{.sc} for data, Cypress for integration testing, and webpack as a build tool. I am constantly eying up [CSS]{.sc}-in-[JS]{.sc} libraries. Yet, while I do consider those things a part of front-end development, they feel cosmically far away from the articles and conversations around accessibility, semantic markup, [CSS]{.sc} possibilities, [UX]{.sc} considerations, and [UI]{.sc} polish, among others. It feels like two different worlds.
