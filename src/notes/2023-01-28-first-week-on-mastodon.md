[I joined Mastodon]({{ site.author.mastodon }}). I’d read others hyping the early-days-of-Twitter energy there, the hum of an emerging community for web people. I didn’t want to miss out!

One week in though, it just hasn’t stuck. Maybe that shouldn’t come as a surprise: I never got into Twitter, so it’s not like I have some well of nostalgia to draw from.

I think what is comes down to is that, like [Robin](https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/new-avenues/) and [Luke](https://www.lkhrs.com/blog/2022/11/twitter/), I have timeline fatigue. I just don’t find an endless wall of unrelated posts energizing or inviting these days. I find it draining, in fact. (That I have a compulsive need to scroll through *every* post doesn’t help.)

I love my [RSS]{.sc} feed. There are always new things to see there, yet I never feel overwhelmed. I can read as I am able, and if there are things I never get to, that’s just fine. Posts vary in length, but are always of substance, not proscribed to any arbitrary character limit.

I am still excited by the early 2000’s vibes afoot. It’s a unique moment to form new ways of relating online. Those who are enjoying Mastodon should absolutely continue do so, but, to echo Robin, I also hope we can think bigger than what is happening there. “Nothing is settled.”

For now, I’ll stick with [RSS]{.sc}. Heck, everyone I follow on Mastodon already has a blog anyway!
