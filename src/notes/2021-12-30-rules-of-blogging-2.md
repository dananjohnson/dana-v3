title: More on Matt Webb’s Rules for Blogging
---

[Elsewhere Matt says](https://interconnected.org/home/2021/12/23/top_posts): “do write regularly, otherwise each post becomes an event”. When you have a baby in your life, any time invested in yourself feels like an event! I’m not sure it’ll be otherwise for some time, so I’ll just have to accept this one for now and post what I can, when I can. Calling these “notes” was for just this reason: there shouldn’t be pressure to ever say anything substantial. Just jot a quick thought down and publish it.
