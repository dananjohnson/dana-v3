title: Using the platform
---

I really like [this post](https://elisehe.in/2021/08/22/using-the-platform) by Elise Hein on trying to build a stackless website. We’re so used to transpilers these days that how many of us really know how far we can get just using [ES6]{.sc} modules? I like that Elise is enthusiastic about the potential here without showing a hint of puritanism or naïveté. In most cases, we still need to transpile code. And web components just aren’t where they need to be yet to really challenge the dominant [UI]{.sc} frameworks. But there’s value in returning to the bare platform to see and appreciate just how much we get for free nowadays.
