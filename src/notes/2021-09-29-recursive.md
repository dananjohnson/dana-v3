title: Trying out variable fonts
---

The site update felt like a good opportunity to finally try out variable fonts.

I’ve gone with a lovely open-source one called [Recursive](https://www.recursive.design/), which besides the standard axes like weight and slant has a custom sans-to-mono axis and one called “casual”. Fantastic!
