Set up a micropub endpoint for my site today using [indiekit](https://paulrobertlloyd.github.io/indiekit/)! I'm up and running as well with [Micropublish](https://micropublish.net), a simple client for posting notes to that endpoint. With that, I no longer need to open a markdown editor, compose a note (with proper YAML frontmatter), commit it, and push that commit to my GitHub repo (all of which more or less requires me to be at my computer). Now I just open Micropublish from anywhere, compose a note, and post it ðŸ™Œ
