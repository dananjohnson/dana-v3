<p><i>The screenshot garden is an idea taken from <a href="https://maya.land/screenshot-garden/">maya.land</a>, who got it from <a href="https://screenshot.garden/">this</a> and <a href="https://screenshot-garden.neocities.org/">this</a>. Apparently Iâ€™m not the only one who keeps a file of such treasures.</i></p>
