## Background

### Professional
I’m a front-end developer at [Cast Iron Coding](https://castironcoding.com/) in Portland, Oregon. Before that, I did design and development at [Sloop Creative](http://www.sloopcreative.com/), a community-minded creative studio my partner and I started.

### Academic
I completed my M.A. in Asian Cultures and Languages from The University of Texas at Austin in 2013. I worked on the topics of masculinity, asceticism, and medicine in South Asian history, and I studied Sanskrit, Pali, and Hindi. My Master’s Thesis, [“Reckoning Up the Body: Logics of Enumeration and Arrangement in Buddhist and Ayurvedic Inventories of Anatomy,”](http://hdl.handle.net/2152/23788) was a finalist for the UT-Austin Graduate School’s Outstanding Master’s Thesis Award.

## Colophon
This site is an expression of my love for writing code on the [scale of a single person’s needs and wants](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/). (In this case, of course, my own.) It’s also a manifestation of the principles of [minimal computing](http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/thoughts/2016/10/03/tldr/), compiled into nothing but HTML and CSS from some Markdown and a few Nunjucks templates with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).
