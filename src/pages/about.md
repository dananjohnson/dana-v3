## About me

I’m a frontend developer. In my [day job](https://castironcoding.com/), I’m mostly working with React and friends these days. Deep down, I love ✨The Web Platform✨, and am particularly passionate about [HTML]{.sc}, [CSS]{.sc}, accessibility, and progressive enhancement. Reach out anytime at [dana@dana.zone](mailto:dana@dana.zone). You can also find me on [Mastodon]({{ site.author.mastodon }}), [GitHub]({{ site.author.github }}), and [LinkedIn]({{ site.author.linkedin }}).

## Colophon

This site is built on the idea of writing code on the [scale of a single person’s needs and wants](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/). It also manifests the principles of [minimal computing](http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/thoughts/2016/10/03/tldr/): just some static HTML and CSS compiled from Markdown and a few Nunjucks templates using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). The text is set in the open-source font [Recursive](https://www.recursive.design/).
