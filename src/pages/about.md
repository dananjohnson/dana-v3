## About me

I‚Äôm a frontend developer. In my [day job](https://castironcoding.com/), I‚Äôm mostly working with React and friends these days: Next.js, Styled Components, Graph[QL]{.sc}, and insert-[API]{.sc}-here. Deep down, I love ‚ú®The Platform‚ú®, and am particularly passionate about [HTML]{.sc}, [CSS]{.sc}, accessibility, and progressive enhancement. Reach out anytime at dana at dana dot zone.

## Colophon

This site is built on the idea of writing code on the [scale of a single person‚Äôs needs and wants](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/). (Mine in this case, of course! üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) It also manifests the principles of [minimal computing](http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/thoughts/2016/10/03/tldr/): just some static HTML and CSS compiled from Markdown and a few Nunjucks templates using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). The text is set in the open-source font [Recursive](https://www.recursive.design/).
