title: Year-in-Review (2018 Edition)
---

2018 was a big year! Here are just a few of the things that happened:
* I began working as a frontend developer at [Cast Iron Coding](https://castironcoding.com/).
* We moved to Portland, Oregon.
* I helped launch an interactive, open-access digital edition of the first-ever translation of the Buddhist text _ApadƒÅna_ into English.
* I redesigned my [personal website]({{ site.url }}).

In May, I left the freelance life to start doing web development full-time. My activity feed on Github captures the change pretty well. (Look at that new work-life balance!)

I grew a lot as a developer this year. I‚Äôm especially proud of the improvements I made in learning JavaScript. Before this year, my JS ‚Äúskills‚Äù were sloppy and outdated. This past year, I gained some degree of fluency simply by using it every single day. I‚Äôve obviously got a ton still to learn, but I don‚Äôt dread writing JavaScript anymore. (Coding in ES6 and React have certainly added to the fun!)

I‚Äôm also proud to have been involved in building v2.0 of [Manifold](http://manifoldapp.org/), doing most of the frontend work for the app‚Äôs backend redesign, as well as a new feature in 2.0 called Project Collections. Working on this project has been a natural extension of my interests in Digital Humanities, but technically has been on a scale far more complex than anything I‚Äôve ever worked on.

Meanwhile, I did deep dives into accessibility (with a nod to [Inclusive Components](https://inclusive-components.design/)) and managing icons (use SVG!), learned CSS Grid (ü§ó), and revisited approaches to CSS architecture and naming conventions (SCSS and BEM remain top-of-class).

## Looking ahead to 2019
It was a great year, and I‚Äôm looking forward to continuing to grow in 2019. Here are some of my goals:
* become more skilled at progressive enhancement
* make accessibility a core part of everything I build
* learn how to better evaluate performance and accessibility
* continue building my JavaScript skillset, including interaction with API<span>s</span>, service workers, and higher proficiency with React

On the side, I‚Äôd really like to do some kind of side project inspired by [Low-Tech Magazine](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/09/how-to-build-a-lowtech-website/) and [Minimal Computing](http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/thoughts/2016/10/03/tldr/). I‚Äôm not sure what that will look like yet, but I think it‚Äôll be a stimulating and critical complement to my usual work.

Beyond this, I‚Äôm also hoping to blog more often, read at least one book a month, and meet some financial goals that have been a long time coming. Here‚Äôs to making it all happen!
